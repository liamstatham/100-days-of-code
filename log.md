# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 01, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Focusing on continuing to build a foundation in Python using FreeCodeCamp. Begining with: Objects : https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/python-for-everybody/objects-a-sample-class

** Learnt **

- Objects
    - Class (A template)
    - Atribute (A variable within a class)
    - Method (A function within a class)
    - Object (A particular instance of a class)
    - Constructor (Code that runs when an object is created)
    - Inheritance (The ability to extend a class to make a new class)
    
- Where I got too...
    I managed to get to the database part of PY4E during James's nap! Maybe i'll get to do somemore when he has gone to sleep.
    
    --Update 20:00 pm
    Watched relational database video and installed SQLite, figured out the UI, created a database and used SQL.
    More relational database recap, primary/foreign keys and database design.
    (SQLite data lookup - https://www.py4e.com/lectures3/Pythonlearn-15-Database-Handout.txt)
    Created another relational database with foreign keys as an example.
    
    Tomorows starting point: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/python-for-everybody/relational-databases-join-operation

**Thoughts** I really want to improve my coding, as an expert in SQL with an interest in data I want to be able to manipulate the data in different ways. Potentially with a view to data viz or data analysis. Maybe even to create actual software. 
I am struggling with time, due to looking after a toddler. 

Finding time late at night is also quite tiring, will be worse when I start work after the Christmas break next week. 
Signing off @ 21:30.
