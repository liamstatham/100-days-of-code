# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Jan 01, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Focusing on continuing to build a foundation in Python using FreeCodeCamp. Begining with: Objects : https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/python-for-everybody/objects-a-sample-class

** Learnt **

- Objects
    - Class (A template)
    - Atribute (A variable within a class)
    - Method (A function within a class)
    - Object (A particular instance of a class)
    - Constructor (Code that runs when an object is created)
    - Inheritance (The ability to extend a class to make a new class)
    
- Where I got too...
    I managed to get to the database part of PY4E during James's nap! Maybe i'll get to do somemore when he has gone to sleep.
    
    --Update 20:00 pm
    Watched relational database video and installed SQLite, figured out the UI, created a database and used SQL.
    More relational database recap, primary/foreign keys and database design.
    (SQLite data lookup - https://www.py4e.com/lectures3/Pythonlearn-15-Database-Handout.txt)
    Created another relational database with foreign keys as an example.
    
    Tomorows starting point: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/python-for-everybody/relational-databases-join-operation

Thoughts :
I really want to improve my coding, as an expert in SQL with an interest in data I want to be able to manipulate the data in different ways. Potentially with a view to data viz or data analysis. Maybe even to create actual software. 
I am struggling with time, due to looking after a toddler. 

Finding time late at night is also quite tiring, will be worse when I start work after the Christmas break next week. 
Signing off @ 21:30.

### Day 2: Jan 02, Saturday

### Project Idea:
    - Web scraper to automatically pull details of Forest game stats into a database, which can then be used to create data viz.

**Today's Progress**: Focusing on continuing to build a foundation in Python using FreeCodeCamp. Begining with: yesterdays end point - Relationahl databases. This is more of a recap as I am experienced with databases, SQL and app data. 

- Where I got too...
    - Managed to get a quick 30 mins in during James's nap and before Preston V Forest. 
    - Further database modelling theory, new SQLite db created with many to many relationships and lookup tables (junction tables). 
    - Signing off @ 14:36pm 
    - Back online @ 20:20pm (with a dark hot chocolate) ready to do some excersizes. 
        - Starting with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ3Qv1z_Vao
        - Created example db and tested. Fully commented for future eval, uploading to github.
        - Messed around with atom.io trying to link my github account, there's a bug that stops you from connecting to a github project if you already have one open on atom.io!
        - Set up connecton to github db folder and pushed changes.
    
Examples to follow this evening/later:

- Next topic
    - https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/python-for-everybody/visualizing-data-with-python
    (looking forward to this one).

Thoughts :
Enjoyed learning about SQLite, a little different to T-SQL but still easy to familiarise with. Followed and creatd an example, but fully commented to show understanding and uploaded this to my repo under (DB). Will get used to spending an hour in the evening on coding, hopefully I will be able to wind down after.

Signing off 21:30pm. bonne nuit.

### Day 3: Jan 03, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Signed on at 19:15. Continuing the Python & SQLite exercises, starting with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEkUEAz8j3o (creating many to many tables with multiple FKs). Created the exercise and fully noted, uploaded to github DB repo. It parses through a JSON file and inserts the data into 3 different tables in a new SQLite db. Watched the other videos but do not want to use twitter API's and upload my keys to github...
Began watching the dataviz videos, following through the code. 
Further reading on d3.js required, looks interesting. 
Data viz exercises are here listed beneath this video https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/python-for-everybody/visualizing-data-with-python

Scientific computing with Python course is now 100% complete! Will need to go back and re-cover the examples. Been a good course. There are some projects to do too. 
Signing off 20:30 (had a bad nights sleep last night, so trying to change routine. Hopefully I will be able to continue tomorrow as I am back at work.)

### Day 4: Jan 04, Monday
